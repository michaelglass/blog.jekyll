# Introduction to Low Pro for Prototype

Tonight I gave a lightweight introduction to [Low Pro](http://lowprojs.com) for Prototype at the [Öresund JavaScript meetup](http://www.meetup.com/The-Oresund-JavaScript-Meetup/).

For those that missed it, or just want to study the example again, you can [see the slides as a PDF](/presentations/introduction-to-low-pro-for-prototype/Introduction-to-Low-Pro-for-Prototype.pdf), [see the sample](/presentations/introduction-to-low-pro-for-prototype/intro.html) or [download a zip file with everything](presentations/introduction-to-low-pro-for-prototype/Introduction-to-Low-Pro-for-Prototype.zip).

The meetup was very informal and there were also two other presentations: Mats Bryntse gave an overview of "What's new in EcmaScript 3.1" and Rasmus Olausson showed us a "Hello world with Google Web Toolkit" as well as how to beat his Sudoku webapp :-)

After the presentations were well tucked away, we talked about who and what we'd like to see at [Öredev 2009](http://www.oredev.org/).
