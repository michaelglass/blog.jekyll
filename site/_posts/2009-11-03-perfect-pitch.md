# Perfect Pitch

[Perfect Pitch](http://adactio.com/journal/1623/) is an article by Jeremy Keith that discusses some recent issues and misuses of DMCA unfairly to destroy competitors search engine rankings.

It all started out as an innocent comment about attaining [Perfect Pitch](http://www.thesession.org/discussions/display/21250) on The Session.

This is really just another one of those examples of American legislation that got implemented without any real thought of the consequences or of how it could be misused, not entirely unlike the Intellectual Property and Patents legislation in the U.S. *GO Lobbyists!!!*

Help Jeremy out, and create your own Perfect Pitch post and even better, link to the other two.
