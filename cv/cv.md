### Other programming languages

Over the time of my career I've naturally spent time with many programming languages, the ones listed above are the ones that I am currently excited about working with.


## Application frameworks and libraries

| Name                    | Level     | Years | Last used |
|-------------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| [jQuery][jquery]        | Advanced  | 5+    | 2016      |
| [Prototype][prototype]  | Advanced  | 4     | 2009      |
| [RequireJS][requirejs]  | Advanced  | 3     | 2014      |
| [Backbone][backbone]    | Advanced  | 3     | 2016      |
| [Mustache][mustache]    | Advanced  | 3     | 2016      |
| [Ruby on Rails][rails]  | Confident | 5     | 2012      |

I have worked with other frameworks and libraries, like Ember.

I remain sceptical of current clientside MVC frameworks, as the limitations they impose often leads to non-obvious code and shoe horning an application into a framework that was most likely built to solve a different problem.

Code craftsmanship excites me a lot more than frameworks. I often advocate that more developers read books like [Clean Code][cleancode] and [Working Effectively with Legacy Code][legacycode].

## Test frameworks, runners and libraries

## Recommendations
> Morgan is a good thinker, excellent language skills for a non-english developer, outstanding coder, always strives to leave an organisation in a better place technically than it was when he began. Strongly believes in standards, testable code, working the right way instead of the easy way. He's not afraid to disagree when he thinks you are wrong and in my experience, he's usually right to. If I had a dream developer team, he'd be on it.

Scott van Looy, Presentation Technical Architect at AKQA Berlin

> I had a pleasure to work with Morgan for 1.5 year. I remember very distinctively from my first day at Nokia that he was the first person to show me my way around in the new project. He's a great colleague and one of the best programmers I know. Morgan is smart and get things done. He learns constantly about new developments in web technology and several times he introduced to our project new tools that greatly helped us. I learned a lot from him. Morgan has a strong personality and was one of the most important driving forces in our team. He cares a lot for the overall success of a project and strikes the perfect balance between deadlines and code quality. If you have a challenging project and need a star developer to help you – Morgan is the man.

Krzysztof Szafranek, Web front-end architect, Nokia, 2011-05-16

> Morgan is a developer with high integrity regarding his work, and will always try to leave his client's code base or process better than he found it. He's highly knowledgeable in tools, practices and processes, and this competence together with his attention to detail produces consistently high level results. Expert frontend developer.

Magnus Nilsson, Scrum Master, Nokia, 2011-07-06

> I've worked with Morgan for over a year, and have only good things to say. He takes responsibility and ownership beyond of what is stated in his contract. He comes with constructive suggestions and tangible improvements both for the development process, as well as the product or service under construction. Due to his long experience, those suggestions are really worth listening to. Morgans best trait, however, is that he is not afraid to raise concerns or point out problems, regardless of whether he's talking to the CEO or co-developer. This sobering view is the most important things a consultant can bring to any project, in my opinion.

Kai Inkinen, Senior Specialist at Futurice Gmbh, 2011-11-01

> We had Morgan as one of the strongest contributors in our team of highly skilled web frontend-developers. He combines excellent knowledge of latest web technologies with extra-ordinary dedication to results delivered on time and according to highest quality standards. He is always interested to optimize both solution & value for his customer. I fully recommend Morgan to all teams that strive for product excellence.
