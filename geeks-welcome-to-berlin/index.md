# Geeks, welcome to Berlin

Dear occasional visitor, welcome to Berlin.

I've tried to compile a list of things that a travelling geek might want to know when visiting Berlin.

Perhaps you're attending one of our many lovely tech conferences, or visiting a geeky friend in the city.

This page is far from complete, but I hope it'll help you started on the right foot.

## Getting to Alexanderplatz from an airport.

If you're visiting via an airport, you'll probably want to go to Alexanderplatz and then get your bearings from there.

Then in doubt, or if you're not going to Alexanderplatz, The [BVG journey planner](http://www.bvg.de/index.php/en/index.html) is quite good, as are the route planning apps (see below).

### From TXL
From Tegel Airport, the easiest way to get to Alexanderplatz is to take the "TXL" bus route that goes directly there. You'll need an AB ticket, which will cost €2.60 and is valid for the rest of your journey inside the AB zone.

**Don't forget to validate your ticket**

Or, you can take a taxi, should be about €25 to Alexanderplatz.

### From SXF
From Schönefeld Airport, you have the option of two different train connections. I recommend taking the regional train (not the S-bahn). You'll need an ABC ticket, which will cost €3.20 and is valid for the rest of your journey inside the ABC zone.

**Don't forget to validate your ticket**

Or, you can take a taxi, should be about €35 to Alexanderplatz.

## Getting a data plan

First things first, you will probably want a data plan for one or more of your devices for your visit, right?

[http://prepaidwithdata.wikia.com/wiki/Germany](http://prepaidwithdata.wikia.com/wiki/Germany) has a good overview of what is available.

### Recommendation - blau.de
In Berlin, blau.de works fairly well, and is quite affordable. It's easy enough to understand their website using just Google Translate in Chrome.

You can get sim cards from [Media Markt in Alexa on Alexanderplatz](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=Alexa&data=!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x0%3A0x519409aa3f6cb7e6!3m8!1m3!1d2010!2d13.41475!3d52.51998!3m2!1i1308!2i636!4f13.1!4m2!3d52.5199797!4d13.4147492) for €10 (which gives you €10 credit), and top up credit from most drug stores and small convenience stores. You probably want €10 extra credit, so you can get the "Internet-Flat 1 GB" option for €9.90.

Make sure you get the sim card size for your phone! If you don't know what size, just ask in the shop, they're capable and helpful.

Bonus points for talking a friend in Berlin into buying it for you ahead of your arrival, so there's one thing less to worry about.

## Money

Berlin operates mostly on cash, so you'll want some.

Luckily there are cash machines everywhere.

Beware of the fees when getting cash. If it's not free, you can expect to pay ~€5 per transaction.

You can find details of the fee structure on every cash machine. When in doubt, always get €200 or more to beat the minimum fee.

### App
I use the [Geldautomat Suche](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/geldautomat-suche-ihre-kostenlose/id438417025?mt=8) app to find banks in CashGroup (which means I can take out cash without fees).

You should probably check your cards, and see if there are some that allows you to get cash without fees.

## Getting around

Berlin has an excellent public transport system, consisting of:

High speed long distance rail
Local rail
S-bahn (above ground)
U-bahn (below ground)
Tram (streetcars)
Busses

The tickets might not look the same, but they do cover all systems and allows you to transfer from one to the other to complete your journey.

There are also taxis. In my experience, they're reasonably priced compared to Scandinavia and drivers take the most direct route or ask your preference if you show German proficiency.

### Getting around - apps

Get one of the official apps to help planning your travel through the city, you can load these onto your phone even before you leave your home.

iOS — [iFahrinfo](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/berlin-brb/id409357982?mt=8)

Android — [Fahrinfo Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.vbb)

A reader recommends [Öffi for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.oeffi&hl=en), as a more user friendly alternative to the BVG app. I haven't tried it, let me know if you find it useful!

Also, Google has added Berlin public transit to the routing in the Maps apps on iOS, I suspect that means it's already in Android.

### BVG - tickets

You can buy tickets in all Rail, S-bahn, U-bahn stations as well as on trams and busses.

The [Tickets & Fares](http://www.bvg.de/index.php/en/17182/name/Single+Tickets+and+Day+Ticket.html) page should have all the information you need.

Notice, that the ticket machines in stations only accept cash and EC (Maestro) cards, and that machines in trams only accept coins.

You can buy tickets ahead of time. Remember to validate your ticket when starting a journey.

If you're exploring and not spending the day at a conference or working, a day ticket is well worth the price. There are also tickets that span 3-5 days.

### Taxis
If I can't immediately see a free taxi, I use the [mytaxi app](https://www.mytaxi.com/en/home.html) to hail a taxi.

### Uber
I haven't used them yet, but the [Uber limosine service](https://www.uber.com/) has arrived in Berlin.

## Coffee

Caffeination is important.

There are a number of really good coffee places in Berlin. I am sure that your friendly resident geeks will be more than happy to share their preferences with you.

I maintain a [list of my favourite coffee places](https://foursquare.com/user/79085/list/coffee) on Foursquare.

## Food && Drink

I also maintain a list of [favourite restaurants] on Foursquare as well as a [short list of Berlin bars](https://foursquare.com/user/79085/list/berlin-bars).

## Free wifi

A lot of places offer free wifi, usually you just have to ask for the password, or your can use [http://4sqwifi.com](http://4sqwifi.com) to find free wifi. Germans use the term "WLAN", (pronounced VEE-LAN), so use that when asking for the password.

Be a good sport and buy a coffee, meal, beer, whatever so cafes and bars will continue to supply this hospitality to everyone.

## Questions?

Have I forgotten something important? Please send questions to [@mrgnrdrck](https://twitter.com/mrgnrdrck/) and I'll try to answer questions here.
