Morgans Kräftskiva 2012!
=========================


You are hereby invited to attend the annual crayfish party!

Ever since moving to Sweden, I have been looking for local customs to adopt ... anyone with even cursory knowledge of me, will agree that the yearly crayfish feast is an obvious choice.

I have of course tried to add my own touch to the ritual, while maintaining the cherished traditions of eating and drinking like there was no tomorrow.

Where
-------------------------

Stenbocksgatan 6<br/>
211 50 Malmö<br/>
Sweden

![Map showing Morgan's home](http://staticmap.openstreetmap.de/staticmap.php?center=55.602447180894,13.008050916055&zoom=15&size=600x400&markers=55.601186460103,13.012943265298,lightblue1)

When
-------------------------

Saturday August 11th 2012, from 14.00 hours and onwards.

If you arrive earlier, please let me know in advance, and I'll make sure there's a drink and some work in the kitchen ready for you when you arrive.

Last year we tried to cure hangovers on Sunday with a BBQ brunch in the yard. I am not sure if we cured the hangovers, but people seemed to enjoy it, so it's likely to be repeated again this year. Plan to stick around for a little bit on Sunday as well.

Accomodation
-------------------------

There are plenty of hotels to choose from in Malmö, most are within drunken walking distance from my home.

<http://booking.com> has been good for me in the past.

I also have a couple of mattresses, if you feel like crashing in the living room. Feel free to call dibs on them.

And of course, if you happen to know someone local who is also attending, you could try and persuade them to host you :-)

Getting there
-------------------------

From Copenhagen Airport ([CPH](http://cph.dk)) take the train to Malmö, get off the train at Triangeln station. Takes about 25 mins, train is every 20 mins.

From Berlin, there is also a night train <http://www.berlin-night-express.com/> directly to Malmö ... which is expensive, but quite the experience.

Once we get closer to the actual date, I'll try to organise a local guide to come pick up groups at Triangeln train station.

What to expect?
-------------------------

### Eating

There will be plenty of food! The meal is traditionally centered around eating crayfish, but there will also be other items on the menu, friendly to both both vegetarians and those less enthusiastic about seafood. If you have special requirements (vegan, allergies), please let me know well in advance, so I can make the meal joyful for you.

For more details, [read the wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayfish_party)

And on Youtube, [Swedish Midsummer commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I5BGsK5ZAU&feature=fvwrel) ... which is nothing like the crayfish parties, but quite amusing.

### Drinking

There will be plenty of drinks, alcoholic and the other kind. Traditionally beer and snaps are consumed in large quantities, but expect all sorts of beverages. Should you be inclined to bring more beverages, be prepared to share :-)

### Singing, Speeches

Expect all sorts of merriment. The Swedes are a very merry people, who love to sing (fun/naughty/amusing) songs, once you get a few beers in them.

Feel free to print leaflets with your favourite (fun/naughty/amusing) songs and be prepared to teach them to the rest of the (drunken) crowd

If you feel like preparing a speech or inspiration seizes you, then by all means speak!

### Weather

If the weather permits, and the size of our crowd is not too large, we might sit outside most of the evening. Scandinavian summers can sometimes get a little chilly at night, so bringing a jumper or a light jacket might not be entirely foolish.

RSVP
-------------------------

Please let me know if you're attending by 28th of July 2012.

**P.S.** Please don't bring s(ch)naps as a gift! I have so much left over from last year, that we're unlikely to get through it all. Other beverages are welcome. If you insist on a gift, then [Kiva Cards](http://www.kiva.org/gifts/kiva-cards) are a favourite.
